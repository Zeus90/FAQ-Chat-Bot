        "Question": "Are my parent's required to pay the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) to the school?",
        "Answer": "No. The Expected Family Contribution is a federal calculation that determines the amount the family (parent(s) and/or student) should pay toward the educational costs. The calculation examines the contribution by assessing prior year earnings, savings, etc. If the student or parent cannot meet the EFC because of a change in prior year income or other expenses such as medical or elementary school tuition, the student should contact a financial aid representative with this information."

    {
        "Question": "If I am not eligible for a Pell Grant, are there other types of financial aid I can receive?",

If you submit the FAFSA in a timely manner (early in the application cycle), the school may consider you for institutional aid and University grants. Grant funds are not endless -- they are limited to monies in these fund accounts. Grants are awarded until fund accounts are drained. Be prepared and file your FAFSA early!"
